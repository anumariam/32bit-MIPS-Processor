# 32bit-MIPS-Processor
MIPS architecture is one of the first commercially 
available RISC processor. MIPS stands for ‘Microprocessor
without Interlocked Pipeline Stages’. In a normal MIPS RISC
architecture, for 32-bit multiply operation it can hold the
processor for more than 32 clock cycles, which affects the
processor performance. In order to avoid this problem, here we
have implemented 32-bit MIPS processor with one CISC
operation for multiplication which is realized using a Booth
multiplier. Processor is tested in Xilinx Nexsys Spartan3 board,
using a 177MHz clock frequency.
